            <p>By using FitCommit ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them
                carefully before using our services.</p>

                these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Commitments and Pledges</h2>
            <p>When you create a commitment, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the specified fitness goal within the timeframe</li>
                <li>Verify activities honestly through the App</li>
                <li>Have the staked amount charged if you fail to meet your goal</li>
                <li>Have the charged amount processed as an accountability penalty and directed to your selected charity
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Commitments are binding once created. The minimum stake is $1 and maximum is $10,000.</p>

            <h2>3. Activity Verification</h2>
            <p>All activities must be verified through the App using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A photo taken at the time of the activity</li>
                <li>Location data (when enabled) to confirm venue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use AI analysis to evaluate submissions. AI decisions are final. Deliberately submitting fraudulent
                photos may result in account termination.</p>

            <h2>4. Payments and Charges</h2>

                <li>Payments are processed securely via Stripe</li>

                <li>Failed commitments result in automatic charges</li>

                <li>You authorize us to charge your payment method for penalties</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Penalty charges for failed commitments are generally non-refundable as they are immediately processed.
                However, you may request a refund within 48 hours if:</p>

                <li>An unauthorized charge occurred</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

            <h2>8. Accountability and Charity</h2>

                charged a penalty as agreed. Penalty amounts are directed to the charity you selected during commitment
                creation. We partner with established charitable organizations. FitCommit is not a charity and does not
                claim tax-deductible status for these payments. We are not responsible for how charities use the funds
                they receive.</p>

                <li>Fraudulent activity or submissions</li>
                <li>Payment failures or disputes</li>
                <li>Abuse of the App or other users</li>
            </ul>
