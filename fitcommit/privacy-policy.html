        <main>
            <p>FitCommit ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our mobile application and services.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>Account Information</h3>
            <p>When you create an account using Apple Sign-In, we collect your name and email address (if you choose to share them). We also generate a unique user identifier.</p>

            <h3>Activity Data</h3>
            <p>When you log activities, we collect photos you upload to verify your workouts. These photos are stored securely in our cloud infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Location Data</h3>
            <p>With your permission, we collect precise location data when you verify activities. This helps us confirm you are at a fitness facility. Location data is only collected when you actively use the verification feature.</p>

            <h3>Payment Information</h3>
            <p>Payment processing is handled by Stripe. We do not store your full credit card number. We store a reference to your Stripe customer ID and default payment method for processing commitment penalties.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide and maintain our services</li>
                <li>Verify your fitness activities using AI analysis</li>
                <li>Process penalty charges for failed commitments</li>
                <li>Direct penalty amounts to your selected charity</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>3. AI Photo Analysis</h2>
            <p>We use Google Gemini AI to analyze photos you submit for activity verification. The AI evaluates whether your photo depicts a legitimate fitness activity. Photos are sent to Google's servers for analysis. Google may process this data according to their privacy policy. We do not use your photos to train AI models.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We share data with the following third-party services:</p>

            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit (TLS), secure cloud storage, and access controls. Payment data is handled by Stripe in compliance with PCI-DSS standards.</p>
